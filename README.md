# Diabetic_Retinopathy_Prediction_ML_Project

A machine learning project that predicts Diabetic Retinopathy using four medical features: Age, Systolic BP, Diastolic BP, and Cholesterol.
The project uses SVM Classifier, feature scaling, and Streamlit for deployment.

This project aims to support early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy and help patients take timely medical action.
